The User will be able to click the create new card button at the top of the screen 

They can then Edit the name of the deck and add more cards to it

After the user creates or updates the deck we set it so an alert would show giving the user needed feedback and sends them
back to the home page to make it easier from them to navigate the App

The user is also able to press the flashcard button to practice on their knowledge

The Test button gives the user a test on of their deck and will require the user to type out their answer

The results of the test will be displayed with an alert that will allow the user to review their answers and try again
